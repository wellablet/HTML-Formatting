        <p>
            <p>&#128073; In HTML,for example ＜h1＞ elemant is a Semantic element,which gives the text it wraps around the role(or meaning) of``a top level heading on your page``</p>
            <p><mark> &#x25B6; Here is a top level heading</mark></p>
            <p>&#128073; By dedult, most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an ＜h1＞ with a large font size to make it look a heading (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted). On the pther hand,you could make any element look like a top level heading.</p>
            <p><mark> &#x25B6; Consider the following</mark></p>
            <p> &#8688; This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantik value, so it will not get any extra benefits as describe above. Its therefore  good idea to use the right HTML element for the tight jpb.</p>
            <p> &#8688; HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its defult prenstation stlying. Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.</p>

        <legend><strong> of the  benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:</strong></legend>
        <ul>
            <li>Search engine will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO">SEO</a> )</li>
            <li>Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page</li>
            <li>Finding blocks of meaningful codes is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes</li>
            <li>Sugessts to the developer the type of data that will be populated</li>
            <li>Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming</li>

        <p>&#x2B50; <mark>SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</mark> is the process of making a website more  visible in search results, also termed search rankings.</p>
        <p>&#x2B50; Search engines <strong>erawl</strong> the web, following links from page to page, and index the content found. When you search, the search engine displys the indexed content. Crowles follow rules. If you follow those rules closely when doing SEO for a website, you give the site the best chances of
        showing up among the first result, increasing trafic and possible revenue (<em>for ecommerce and ads</em> ).</p>
        <p>&#x2B50; Search engines give some guidelines for SEO, but big search engines keep result ranking as a trade secret, SEO combines offcial search engine guidelines, empirical knowledge,and theorical knowledge from science paaers or patents.</p>
